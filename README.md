# AMLAS-Tool-Visio-Add-In
AMLAS Tool Visio Add In (VSTO)

New Visio Office Add In (VSTO) to support the adoption of Assuring Machine Learning for use in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS). The add in guides users through the recommendations made in AMLAS v1.1 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01564) to aid assuring the safety of machine learning components in autonomous systems. 

The tool will provide an easy-to-use platform that supports the following areas:

1.  The application of the defined AMLAS process through an intuitive user interface. This would provide a front-end that supports engineers in tracking the application of the AMLAS process and the development of the assurance case during the development of an ML component as part of an autonomous system. The user interface would also provide the means for establishing and maintaining traceability between the process artefacts, the integrated engineering models and the assurance argument.

2.  The integration, through the use of model management approaches, of existing tools and models into the AMLAS framework. This will use the relationships established by the user in 1 to extract the required information directly from the engineering models. As well as making the extraction of information more efficient through automation, this will also help to ensure consistency is maintained with respect to the diverse set of models.

3.  The instantiation of AMLAS safety case patterns using data from 1 and 2 above through the application of model weaving. This will provide the user with the ability to generate on demand an up to date snapshot of the current assurance case for the ML component. This can also highlight areas where the assurance case is under-developed, or where information is currently missing.
